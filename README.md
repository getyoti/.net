## An Architectural View

To integrate your application with Yoti, your back-end must expose a GET endpoint that Yoti will use to forward tokens.
The endpoint can be configured in Yoti Hub when you create/update your application.

The image below shows how your application back-end and Yoti integrate in the context of a Login flow.
Yoti SDK carries out for you steps 6, 7 ,8 and the profile decryption in step 9.

![alt text](login_flow.png "Login flow")

Yoti also allows you to enable user details verification from your mobile app by means of the Android (TBA) and iOS (TBA) SDKs. In that scenario, your Yoti-enabled mobile app is playing both the role of the browser and the Yoti app. By the way, your back-end doesn't need to handle these cases in a significantly different way. You might just decide to handle the `User-Agent` header in order to provide different responses for web and mobile clients.

## Enabling the SDK

To install the Yoti NuGet package you will need to install NuGet. You can find instructions to do that [here](http://docs.nuget.org/ndocs/guides/install-nuget)

To import the latest Yoti SDK into your project, enter the following command from NuGet Package Manager Console in Visual Studio:

```
Install-Package Yoti
```

For other installation methods, see [nuget.org/packages/Yoti](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Yoti)

## Client Initialisation

The YotiClient is the SDK entry point. To initialise it you need include the following snippet inside your endpoint initialisation section:

```cs
const string sdkId = "your-sdk-id";
var privateKeyStream = System.IO.File.OpenText("path/to/your-application-pem-file.pem");
var yotiClient = new YotiClient(sdkId, privateKeyStream);
```

Where:

* `sdkId` is the Client SDK ID generated by Yoti Hub when you create (and then publish) your app. 
* `path/to/your-application-pem-file.pem` - When you create your app on Yoti Hub, your browser generates a .pem file. This is the path to that file.

You'll need to add the correct callback URL to one of the scenarios of your application from the "Applications" sections on [Yoti Hub](https://hub.yoti.com). You also need to make sure that the value of the `data-yoti-scenario-id` attribute in the Yoti button matches the id in the selected scenario.

## Profile Retrieval

When your application receives a **one time use** token via the exposed endpoint (it will be assigned to a query string parameter named `token`), you can easily retrieve the user profile by adding the following to your endpoint handler:

```cs
var activityDetails = yotiClient.GetActivityDetails(oneTimeUseToken);
```

Or if you are in an asynchronous method:

```cs
var activityDetails = await yotiClient.GetActivityDetailsAsync(oneTimeUseToken);
```

## Handling Users
The ActivityDetails includes a unique identifier for the user, named RememberMeId.  You can use this to identify users returning to your application, but if the user completes a share with a different application, Yoti will assign a different RememberMeId.
Applications registered to an organisation may also utilise an additional unique identifier named ParentRememberMeId.  Use this to identify users returning to your organisation.  It is consistent for a given user in all applications registered to a single organisation.

Here is an example of how this works:

```cs
ActivityDetails activityDetails = yotiClient.GetActivityDetails(oneTimeUseToken);

YotiProfile profile = activityDetails.Profile;
var user = YourUserSearchFunction(activityDetails.RememberMeId); //or use ParentRememberMeId
if (user != null)
{
    Image selfie = profile.Selfie?.GetValue();
    string selfieURI = profile.Selfie?.GetValue().GetBase64URI();
    string fullName = profile.FullName?.GetValue();
    string givenNames = profile.GivenNames?.GetValue();
    string familyName = profile.FamilyName?.GetValue();
    string mobileNumber = profile.MobileNumber?.GetValue();
    string emailAddress = profile.EmailAddress?.GetValue();
    DateTime? dateOfBirth = profile.DateOfBirth?.GetValue();       
    string address = profile.Address?.GetValue();
    Dictionary<string, Newtonsoft.Json.Linq.JToken> structuredPostalAddress = profile.StructuredPostalAddress?.GetValue();
    string gender = profile.Gender?.GetValue();
    string nationality = profile.Nationality?.GetValue();
    Yoti.Auth.Document.DocumentDetails documentDetails = profile.DocumentDetails?.GetValue();
    List<Yoti.Auth.Images.Image> documentImages = profile.DocumentImages?.GetValue();
    bool? isAgedOver18 = profile.FindAgeOverVerification(18)?.Result();
    bool? isAgedUnder55 = profile.FindAgeUnderVerification(55)?.Result();
}
else
{
    // handle registration
}
```

Where `yourUserSearchFunction` is a piece of logic in your app that is supposed to find a user, given a RememberMeId or ParentRememberMeId.
No matter if the user is a new or an existing one, Yoti will always provide her/his profile, so you don't necessarily need to store it.

The `profile` object provides a set of attributes corresponding to user attributes. Whether the attributes are present or not depends on the settings you have applied to your app on Yoti Hub.

You can retrieve the anchors, sources and verifiers for each attribute as follows:
```cs
using System.Linq;
using System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates;
using Yoti.Auth.Anchors;

List<Anchor> givenNamesAnchors = profile.GivenNames.GetAnchors();
List<Anchor> givenNamesSources = profile.GivenNames.GetSources();
List<Anchor> givenNamesVerifiers = profile.GivenNames.GetVerifiers();
```
You can also retrieve further properties from these respective anchors in the following way:
```cs
Anchor givenNamesFirstSource = profile.GivenNames.GetSources().First();

AnchorType anchorType = givenNamesFirstSource.GetAnchorType();
List<X509Certificate2> originServerCerts = givenNamesFirstSource.GetOriginServerCerts();
byte[] signature = givenNamesFirstSource.GetSignature();
DateTime signedTimeStamp = givenNamesFirstSource.GetSignedTimeStamp().GetTimestamp();
string subType = givenNamesFirstSource.GetSubType();
string value = givenNamesFirstSource.GetValue();
```

## AML Integration

Yoti provides an AML (Anti Money Laundering) check service to allow a deeper KYC process to prevent fraud. This is a chargeable service, so please contact [sdksupport@yoti.com](mailto:sdksupport@yoti.com) for more information.

Yoti will provide a boolean result on the following checks:

* PEP list - Verify against Politically Exposed Persons list
* Fraud list - Verify against  US Social Security Administration Fraud (SSN Fraud) list
* Watch list - Verify against watch lists from the Office of Foreign Assets Control

To use this functionality you must ensure your application is assigned to your Organisation in the Yoti Hub - please see [here](https://developers.yoti.com/yoti-app/web-integration#step-1-creating-an-organisation) for further information.

For the AML check you will need to provide the following:

* Data provided by Yoti (please ensure you have selected the Given name(s) and Family name attributes from the Data tab in the Yoti Hub)
  * Given name(s)
  * Family name
* Data that must be collected from the user:
  * Country of residence (must be an ISO 3166 3-letter code)
  * Social Security Number (US citizens only)
  * Postcode/Zip code (US citizens only)

### Consent

Performing an AML check on a person *requires* their consent.
**You must ensure you have user consent *before* using this service.**

### AML Example

#### 1) Setup
1) Navigate to the [src/Examples/Aml/AmlExample](src/Examples/Aml/AmlExample) folder

1) Fill in the environment variables in this file with the ones specific to your application (mentioned in the [Client initialisation](#client-initialisation) section). Whether to use a USA address or not can be configured by changing the `USA_EXAMPLE` environment variable to `true` or `false` (default is false).

#### 2a) With Visual Studio
1) Right click on "AmlExample" in the Solution Explorer and select "Set as StartUp Project"
1) Run the project

#### 2b) From command line
1) (From the [src/Examples/Aml/AmlExample](src/Examples/Aml/AmlExample) folder)  enter `dotnet run`

## Running the Profile Examples
